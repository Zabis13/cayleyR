Introduction to cayleyR

# cayleyR

**cayleyR** is an R package for analyzing Cayley graphs of permutation
groups, with a focus on the TopSpin puzzle and similar combinatorial
problems. The package implements algorithms for cycle detection, state
space exploration, and finding optimal operation sequences in
permutation groups generated by shift and reverse operations.

## Features

- **Basic permutation operations**: cyclic left/right shifts, prefix
  reversal

- **Cycle analysis**: find cycles in Cayley graphs with detailed
  information about visited states

- **Sequence optimization**: search for operation sequences that produce
  maximum cycle length

- **Fast processing**: lightweight version for batch testing of
  combinations

## Package Functions

**shift_left(state)** — performs a cyclic left shift, moving the first
element of the vector to the end.

**shift_right(state)** — performs a cyclic right shift, moving the last
element of the vector to the beginning.

**reverse_prefix(state, k)** — reverses the order of the first k
elements of the state vector (the “turnstile” operation in TopSpin).

**apply_operations(state, operations, k)** — sequentially applies a set
of operations to the state. Operations are specified by symbols: “L”/“1”
(left), “R”/“2” (right), “X”/“3” (reverse).

**get_reachable_states(start_state, allowed_positions, k)** — finds the
complete cycle in the Cayley graph for a given operation sequence.
Returns all visited states, a data frame with the trajectory, and cycle
statistics.

**get_reachable_states_light(start_state, allowed_positions, k)** —
lightweight version of the cycle search function. Returns only cycle
length and the number of unique states without storing all intermediate
states. Used for fast testing of many sequences.

**find_best_random_combinations(moves, combo_length, n_samples, n_top,
start_state, k)** — generates random operation sequences of a given
length and finds those that produce maximum cycle length. Returns the
top-N best combinations with their characteristics.

## Applications

The package can be useful for:

- Investigating mathematical properties of permutation puzzles

- Analyzing Cayley graphs and their structure

- Finding optimal algorithms for solving combinatorial problems

- Educational purposes in group theory and combinatorics

## Dependencies

The package uses:

- **digest** — for efficient state hashing during cycle search
