Description: Tools for analyzing Cayley graphs of permutation groups, with a focus
    on the TopSpin puzzle and similar permutation-based combinatorial puzzles.
    The package implements algorithms for cycle detection, state space exploration,
    and finding optimal operation sequences in permutation groups generated by
    shift and reverse operations.
